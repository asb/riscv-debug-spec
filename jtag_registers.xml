    <register name="Debug Bus Access" short="dbus" address="0x11"

        This register allows access to the Debug Bus.

        In Update-DR, the DTM starts the operation specified in \Fop unless the
        current status reported in \Fop is sticky.

        In Capture-DR, the DTM updates \Fdata with the result from that
        operation, updating \Fop if the current \Fop isn't sticky.

        See Section~\ref{dbusaccess} and Table~\ref{tab:memread} for examples
        of how this plays out.

        \begin{commentary}
        The still-in-progress status is sticky to accommodate debuggers that
        batch together a number of scans, which must all be executed or stop as
        soon as there's a problem.

        For instance a series of scans may write a Debug Program and execute
        it.  If one of the writes fails but the execution continues, then the
        Debug Program may hang, or have other unexpected side effects.
        \end{commentary}

        <field name="address" bits="abits+33:34" access="R/W" reset="0">
            Address used for Debug Bus access. In Update-DR this value is sent
            to the DM.
        </field>
        <field name="data" bits="33:2" access="R/W" reset="0">
            The data to send to the DM during Update-DR, and the data returned

            When the debugger writes this field, it has the following meaning:

            0: Ignore \Fdata. (nop)

            1: Read from \Faddress. (read)

            2: Read from \Faddress. Then write \Fdata to \Faddress. (write)

            3: Reserved.

            When the debugger reads this field, it means the following:

            0: The previous operation completed successfully.

            1: Reserved.

            2: The previous operation failed. The data scanned into \Rdbus in
            this access will be ignored. This status is sticky and can be
            cleared by writing \Fdbusreset in \Rdtmcontrol.

            3: The previous operation is still in progress. The data scanned
            into \Rdbus in this access will be ignored. This status is sticky
            and can be cleared by writing \Fdbusreset in \Rdtmcontrol. If a
            debugger sees this status, it needs to give the target more time
            between Update-DR and Capture-DR. The simplest way to do that is to
            add extra transitions in Run-Test/Idle.
