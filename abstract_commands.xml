    <register name="Access Register">
        Access the register specified by \Fregno. If \Fsize specifies a size
        larger than the register is, then the access must fail. If a register
        is accessible, then \Fsize matching the register's actual size must be
        supported.

        \begin{steps}{Perform the following sequence of operations:}
        \item Halt the hart, if \Fprehalt is set.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer, if \Fpreexec is set.
        \item Copy data from the specified register into {\tt data}, if \Fwrite is clear.
        \item Copy data from {\tt data} into the specified register, if \Fwrite is set.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer, if \Fpostexec is set.
        \item Resume the hart, if \Fpostresume is set.
        \end{steps}

            When 1, halt the hart before performing the rest of the command.

            If the hart is already halted, the command may fail.

            When 1, resume the hart after performing the rest of the command.

            2: Access the lowest 32 bits of the register.

            3: Access the lowest 64 bits of the register.
